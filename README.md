# Disability-Inclusion-Pre-Post-Survey
This repository hosts access links for a pre- and post-event survey designed to assess changes in employer knowledge, awareness, and intentions regarding the hiring of persons with disabilities. The surveys support a change assessment framework by capturing baseline and follow-up responses before and after an employer engagement event.
